*******************
 How to integrate Jenkins with Github repository

> Connect to AWS ec2 machine- Start the server & start jenkins
> Execute command : 
 sudo su -
systemctl start jenkins
Go to browser : give public ip ofec2 server:8080
http://3.144.203.98:8080/

Demo 1: Create a Jenkisn job that will clone a github repository in jenkins workspace

Create a new job in jenkins
Click on + sign to create new item/job/project
Give a name to the job : CloneRepo
Select freestyle project and click on OK button
On the project click on Source code management
Select git option
Give git hub repo path
https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject05Aug

Branch name as ===>  Master

Save the job

Click on Build now

Repository will be cloned in jenkins workspace

You can go to job → workspace folder to see the files


Jenkins Triggers.
     To automatically execute a jenkins job, you will use Jenkins triggers
       Based on:

      Periodic time- schedule
      Whenever there is a commit in github repo
      A parent job can trigger execution of child job
      Execute a job from remote script

You will go to build triggered section in the job to set up a trigger for automatic execution of the job


Trigger prieodically









Go to Job Clone repo --> build trigger--> build preodically --> give */2 * * * * --> Save and build now


All build will be generated automatically every 2 mins


Build Triggers--> Poll SCM --> * * * * *









Build will be generated each time there is a chnage in the repository only.



Webhook:
Webhooks allow Jenkins to be notified when certain events happen on the repo. When the specified events happen, we’ll send a POST request to each of the URLs you provide.









GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

> Select the above option

Save the job and now go to git hub

Always save the job and then only  go to git hub, perform these steps

go to the repository setting
select webhooks on left side
delete if any exisitng webhook

click on createwebhook on right side

provide following information:

Payload URL : jenkinsurl/github-webhook/ ===> http://3.140.252.165:8080/github-webhook/

Content type : select application/json

Secret: no need of any value

Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?

select first option -- Just the push event.

Select Active
click on add webhook.

now make some changes in repo,
go to jenkins--> you will see a new build has been created

Day 5: Agenda:

> Jenkinsfile

It is a simple text file with no extension
This file contains declarative pipeline code for CI/CD pipeline
The name of this file is always Jenkinsfile
This will is maintained in the root directory of your project repo on SCM tool
Every team member can now make changes to the pipeline code without logging on the jenkins server.
In the github we can also maintain every version of pipeline code
We write the pipeline code in IDE and push the Jenkinsfile in the repository
In jenkins you will create a job, that will fetch the Jenkinsfile and jenkins will execute the pipeline for you.

Demo:

Click on new Item → give the job name as JenkinsfileDemo → Select pipeline project→ press OK
In the job template → click on pipeline tab → select the dropdown option as Pipeline script from SCM
Select SCM as → git
Repository URL? ⇒ https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git

We will also add a trigger → Go to Build triggers tab above→ POLL SCM → * * * * *

So that if there is any commit, my pipeline should get executed everytime.


> MultiBranch Pipeline

Basically we have many branches in github for a repository
Each branch may have separate set of tasks/jobs to be executed
Whenever a branch is created on the repo, Make sure the branch has a Jenkinsfile init
In the Jenkinsfile you write the code which is needed to execute certain tasks related to the branch
we will set up a job in jenkins that will scan every branch of your github repository
Whichever branch has the jenkinsfile present on it
            > for that branch a jenkins pipeline job will be created with same name as branch name  and Jenkinsfile code will be executed

Whichever branch of your repo does not have Jenkinsfile on it. No job will be created for it.


Demo:

Click on new item→ create job -> give name as MultibranchdemoJob → select the template as Multibranch Pipeline → press Ok

In General section → give Display name as :  Multibranch Pipeline

In branch Sources section → Click on Add source → select git

Give git  Project Repository -> https://github.com/Sonal0409/MultiBranchDemo.git

Nomore changes and save the job.

Jenkins will automatically scan the branches of the repo and create pipeline jobs.

Click on multibranch pipeline job name and you will see the 3 jobs created for 3 branches.



> DSL scripts for automation:

Jenkins DSL is a programmatic way to implement the jenkins JOB
In order to write DSL script, you will have to use DSL plugin which will automatically create jobs in jenkins for you
Using the DSL plugin you will be able to create jenkins job on the fly just with help of simple groovy code.
Groovy scripts are very easy to write and read, it is like java

Demo:

Install DSL plugin

Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage plugins → Available → search for DSL → select the plugin Job DSL plugin → click on install without restart.
Now Go to Manage jenkins → Configure global security →Scroll down to CSRF protection and
Uncheck  → Enable script security for Job DSL scripts


Important:
**************
We have to create a job with name as seedjob → in this job we will write the DSL scripts
The operation of seed job is to create new jobs programmatically
Seed job will always be a Freestyle job
In the seed job under Build steps you will write the DSL scripts and execute the seed job.

*******************
DSL script1:
***************
Write DSL script to automatically create a job with name as Firstjob and description as “my first DSL job”

Demo: 
Create a Seed Job in jenkins
New item→ SeedJob → freestyle project–press OK
Go to Build steps → Process Job DSLs —> 
Select the option -> Use the provided DSL script
Define variable in groovy and use it in Job

def jobname = 'Firstjob'

job(jobname){
}


*******
Create job with Description

def jobname = 'Firstjob'

job(jobname){

 description('my testjob')
triggers{
 cron ('* * * * *')
}
}


**************

ADD SCM option

def jobname = 'Firstjob'
def repo = 'sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes'

job(jobname){

 description('my testjob')

scm {
        github repo
    }
}

****************
Add triggers & build step

def jobname = 'Firstjob'
def repo = 'sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes'

job(jobname){

 description('my testjob')

scm {
        github repo
    }
triggers{
 cron ('H/15 * * * *')
}

steps {
 shell ("echo 'Hello World'")
}
}

*********************

Delete job created programitically

jenkins.model.Jenkins.theInstance.getProjects().each { job ->
    if (job.name.contains('job')) {
        println job.name
        job.delete()
    }
}

OR

jenkins.model.Jenkins.theInstance.getProjects().each { job ->
    if (job.name.contains('Job')) {
        println job.name
        job.delete()
    }







Upstream/Downstream pipeline using DSL script job

job('job-checkout') {
    
    scm {
        github('sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes', 'master')
    }
      
   publishers {
        downstream 'job-compile', 'SUCCESS'
    }
    
}
job('job-compile'){
   
  scm {
        github('sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes', 'master')
    }

  steps{
  maven('compile')
  }
 publishers {
        downstream 'job-test', 'SUCCESS'
   }
}

Master and slave architecture in Jenkins






Create a linux slave and dispatch job from master to slave

Create a new EC2 instance with OS as Amazon linux 2
Provide the security group rule 2 also.

Connect to the instance and install following tools:

Execute command to become root

sudo su -

Java:

sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

GIT:

yum install git -y


Maven:

yum install maven -y
Create a root directory
This directory will be used exclusively my Jenkisn master to place remote files and create job workspace
You need to create a directory and give read/write/execute access to it

Execute:

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir jenkinsdir

The path of root directory will be /tmp/jenkinsdir

give read/write/execute access to the root directory

$ chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir

Setup on Jenkins master:

Go to manage jenkins → Configure system → Scroll down to jenkins location and change the Jenkisn URL to be the latest URL

http://3.147.195.251:8080/

Save the page


2. Manage jenkins → configure global security→ scroll down → Agents → select Random radio button

Save the page


Manage Jenkins – Manage nodes and Clouds

Click on + New node

Give node name: slave1

Select Permanent Agent

Click on create

Now give description : anything text

Continuous Deployment

Tomcat server- Installation on EC2  (2 VM, other than the jenkins machine)

Deployment of war file on tomcat server using freestyle project
 > Jenkins plugin : deploy on container

Deployment of war file on tomcat server using pipeline project
 > Jenkins plugin: SSH Agent

Quiz for your end exam


********************************

Deployment Process (for your information)

https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/sample/

The easiest way to run this application is simply to move the war file to your CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory. Tomcat will automatically expand and deploy the application for you. You can view it with the following URL (assuming that you're running tomcat on port 8080 as is the default):
Public ip:8080/sample

Set for tomcat
*****************

Tomcat installation on EC2 instance

Pre-requisites

EC2 instance with Java 11

sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

You can execute the command :

# alternatives --config java

To check java version, it should be 11
Install tomcat:

# Create tomcat directory

Go to the Ec2 machine

cd /opt

#  wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.82/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.82.tar.gz
#  ls   ⇒ you will see the tar file

# tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-8.5.82.tar.gz

Rename the directory

#  mv apache-tomcat-8.5.82 tomcat

#  cd tomcat


# cd bin

# ./startup.sh   ==> tomcat will be up and running

Check point :

access tomcat application from browser on port 8080

<Public_IP>:8080

Lets edit the context.xml file so as to access manager app


# cd ..

# vim /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml

comment this line in the contxt.xml
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />

How: use this symbols:

  <!--  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
# vim /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

comment this line in the contxt.xml
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />

How: use this symbols:

  <!--  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->


Save the files

 Restart tomcat services

#  cd bin

# ./shutdown.sh

# ./startup.sh


Create roles and users

# cd ..
# 
$ cd conf

$ vim tomcat-users.xml

Scroll till bottom and add 

at the end before </tomcat-users> add these roles

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
<role rolename="manager-status"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status"/>
<user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>

Make sure there is no space before each line in the file

Restart tomcat

# cd ..

$ cd bin

$ ./shutdown.sh

$ ./startup.sh

Day 8:
*************************

Scenario 1:

Deploy code on tomcat using Pipeline as code

Algorithm of stages in the pipeline:

Stage 1 -> clone the repo   
Stage2 -> Package the code
Stage3 -> Deployment of war file
 >  jenkins will connect to tomcat server over ssh
> using SSH command(SCP) we will copy the war file from jenkins workspace to the webapps directory of tomcat server


Step 1: Start the tomcat webserver

# cd /opt
# cd tomcat
# cd bin
# ./startup.sh

Step 2: In jenkins – Download a plugin : ssh agent
Install it.

Step 3: Create a pipeline job
Stage 1 -> clone the repo   
Stage2 -> Package the code

Pipeline code for above 2 stages is :

pipeline{
    
    tools{
        jdk 'myjava'
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
    
    agent any
    
    stages{
        stage ('Clone a repo')
        {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage ('Package the code')
        {
            steps{
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
    }
    
}


Now build the job

Go to console output of build.. Scroll down and get the path of workspace where war file is present.

For me it is:

/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PipelineCodeDeployment/target/addressbook.war


Step 4:

In the pipeline click on pipeline syntax

Select from the drop down → SSH Agent

Select the credentials by clicking on ADD button

Select jenkins

Select SSh with username with private key

Give id : tomcatid
Give description as : tomcatid
Give username as : ec2-user
Under Private Key
Click on enter directly
Click on Add button
Go to AWS instance→ scroll right to see the pem file nae

Go to download folder , get your pem file→ open it with notepad.. Copy all content and paster it in jenkins under key

Clcik on ADD

Under SSH agent in the drop down select your usercredentials

Click on generate pipeline script
Copy the script and we will add it in pipeline stage 

 stage('Deploy the code on tomcat server')
        {
            steps{
                
                sshagent(['tomcatid1']) {
                    
    // script to copy war file on webapps directory
    
}
            }
        }


Using SSH we will copy the addressbook.war file in the tomcat webapps directory

The SSh command to copy the .war file is:

 command:  scp  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no filenamelocation username@publicip:Destinationpath

For me it is :

sh 'scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PipelineCodeDeployment/target/addressbook.war ec2-user@18.116.238.106:/opt/tomcat/webapps'

Save the JOB


***** Also an important step is :

Go to tomcat server and give permissions to ec2-user to make changes to webapps directory

Just execute this command:

# chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /opt

Now build the job.


Complete script for CI Cd is:

pipeline{
    
    tools{
        jdk 'myjava'
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
    
    agent any
    
    stages{
        stage ('Clone a repo')
        {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage ('Package the code')
        {
            steps{
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy the code on tomcat server')
        {
            steps{
                
                sshagent(['tomcatid1']) {
                    
    
sh 'scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PipelineCodeDeployment/target/addressbook.war ec2-user@18.116.238.106:/opt/tomcat/webapps'

    
}
            }
        }
    }
    
}
